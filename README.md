# revision-helper
This is a revision tool i made to procrastinate actually revising

I've always struggled with fronted programming, never could wrap my head around it.
I kind of made this to challenge myself, and to prove that i could do it.
And so i did.

WARNING: this is unfinished, so many features either dont work, or are buggy, please bear with, and i will add more to the future
